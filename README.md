# Kosmos

Kosmos is a mobile app that's focused on helping users use cosmetic products that are safe for them by alerting the user of potential allergen conflicts and nearing product expiration dates.

## Contents

- Easy onboarding process, learn the app and get started
- Barcode scanner for fast product information and uploading to your collection
- Choose the date to "open" your product. Most products have a unopened shelf-life of around 3 years, but once opened, the product only lasts 12-24 months.
- Expiration date notifications, as a product in your collection nears the end of its lifecycle, we'll notify you in advance and when it expires
- Allergy conflict notifications. When adding an item to your collection, we'll alert you if there are any conflicting ingredients that may be harmful to you
- Exploration page for miscellaneous cosmetic related images and information
- Info page for questions about the company, cosmetic safety, and how to find out your allergens
- User page where you can add any additional allergies you may have not entered during the onboarding stage

## Technology Decisions

Our technology stack consisted of Xcode/iOS/Swift and Firebase. We chose to use Firebase to store our cosmetic database information because one of ours devs had experience using it before which meant less learning how to set it up.
We had a couple reasons for choosing iOS development. One of our devs had experience with iOS using Swift which counts for a lot because different languages and environments have their own intricacies. Additionally, Xcode is Mac exclusive which we all had, and we all had iPhones so we could test our development on our devices with ease and little to no complications.
